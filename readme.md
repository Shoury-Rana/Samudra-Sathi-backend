Samudra Sathi is a robust backend API designed for a real-time, AI-powered disaster and hazard reporting platform. It leverages the power of Django, Django Rest Framework, and PostGIS to provide a scalable, secure, and geospatially-aware service for collecting, processing, and visualizing incident reports.

## ‚ú® Features

-   üîê **JWT Authentication:** Secure, token-based authentication (login, refresh, logout) using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`.
-   üìù **User & Incident Reporting:** Full CRUD API endpoints for managing users and their submitted incident reports.
-   üß† **AI-Ready Architecture:** A clear data model distinction between raw user reports (`Reported`) and structured, AI-processed data (`CleanedReport`).
-   üó∫Ô∏è **Advanced Geospatial API:**
    -   Serve location data in **GeoJSON** format, ready for modern map libraries (Mapbox, Leaflet).
    -   Filter endpoints by a geographic **bounding box** (`in_bbox`).
    -   High-performance **heatmap/density endpoints** that aggregate data on the fly using raw PostGIS queries.
-   üîß **GIS-Enabled Admin Panel:** A user-friendly Django admin interface with OpenStreetMap widgets for easy location data management.
-   üöÄ **Database Seeding:** Management commands to quickly populate the database with realistic test data for users and reports.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Django, Django Rest Framework
-   **Geospatial:** GeoDjango, PostGIS (PostgreSQL extension)
-   **Authentication:** DRF Simple JWT
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Environment:** Python-dotenv

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your system:
*   Python 3.11+ and Pip
*   Git
*   PostgreSQL with PostGIS enabled.
    *   [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
    *   [Enable PostGIS](https://postgis.net/install/) for your database (`CREATE EXTENSION postgis;`).
*   **GDAL Geospatial Library:** This is a critical dependency for GeoDjango.
    *   **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev`
    *   **macOS (with Homebrew):** `brew install gdal`
    *   **Windows:** This can be complex. The recommended way is to use the [OSGeo4W installer](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). The `settings.py` file in this project contains paths that assume this installation method.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shoury-Rana/samudra-sathi.git
    cd samudra-sathi
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install `GDAL`:**
    ```
    Install wheel from https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels/releases

    Should be similar to: gdal-<gdal_version>-cp<py_version>-cp<py_version>-win_amd64.whl)
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root. Copy the contents of the example below and fill in your database credentials.
    
    **.env.example**
    ```env
    SECRET_KEY='your-strong-secret-key-here'
    DEBUG=True
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost

    # Database Credentials
    DB_NAME=samudra_db
    DB_USER=samudra_user
    DB_PASSWORD=samudra_pass
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    
    # CORS Origins
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
    ```

6.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7.  **Create a superuser for the admin panel:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

8.  **(Optional) Seed the database with sample data:**
    The project includes commands to populate the database with test data, which is highly recommended for exploring the API.
    ```bash
    # Create 500 users with random locations in India
    python manage.py seed_users500

    # Create 500 raw incident reports from those users
    python manage.py seed_reported

    # Create 500 pairs of raw and cleaned reports
    python manage.py seed_cleaned_reports
    ```

9.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into two main Django apps:

-   `users/`: Handles all user-related logic, including the custom user model, authentication, and user location endpoints.
-   `reports/`: Manages all incident reporting logic, including the `Reported` and `CleanedReport` models, serializers, and all geospatial API views.
